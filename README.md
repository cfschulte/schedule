# schedule
A generic member/relationship/schedule database interfaces

This web application is here to develop a cleaner, more efficient
table/editor frontend for a database. The basic working idea is
that of a list of members, which can be a subordinate, a
supervisor, or have some more complex relationship. It determines
relationships between members and when they are scheduled
to interact with each other.

I'm trying to modularize the process as much as possible so I can
focus on user interfaces. 

This is also a chance to get to know git. GitHub is a great chance
to coordinate my projects across multiple platforms. Unfortunately,
It has been a bit of a learning curve.

So, now I'm working on a different branch and it's time to experiment
with things like pull requests. This paragraph was written as
