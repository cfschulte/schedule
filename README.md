# schedule
A generic member/relationship/schedule database interfaces

This web application is here to develop a cleaner, more efficient
table/editor frontend for a database. The basic working idea is
that of a list of members, which can be a subordinate, a
supervisor, or have some more complex relationship. It determines
relationships between members and when they are scheduled
to interact with each other.

I'm trying to modularize the process as much as possible so I can
focus on user interfaces.
