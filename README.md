# schedule
A generic member/relationship/schedule database interfaces

This web application is here to develop a cleaner, more efficient
table/editor frontend for a database. The basic working idea is
that of a list of members, which can be a subordinate, a
supervisor, or have some more complex relationship. It basically 
determines relationships between members and when they are scheduled
to interact with each other.
